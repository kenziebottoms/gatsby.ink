      <h1>What does &ldquo;they/them&rdquo; mean?</h1>
      <p>
        In the context of blue being male and pink being female (which is
        itself a very recent gender convention), I like to describe myself
        as green. It&rsquo;s a little closer to blue than pink, but neither
        end of the spectrum feels wholly right and neither set of conventional
        pronouns fits perfectly.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        I&rsquo;m asking you to use the pronouns &ldquo;they,&rdquo;
        &ldquo;them,&rdquo; and &ldquo;theirs&rdquo; when you talk about me.
      </blockquote>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &ldquo;<strong>They</strong> are at work right now.&rdquo;
        </li>
        <li>
          &ldquo;You can ask <strong>them</strong> if you have questions.&rdquo;
        </li>
        <li>
          &ldquo;<strong>Their</strong> hair is naturally brown.&rdquo;
        </li>
        <li>
          &ldquo;That idea was <strong>theirs</strong>.&rdquo;
        </li>
        <li>
          &ldquo;They are too lazy to make <strong>themself</strong> dinner.&rdquo;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s not a big deal if you mess up; you&rsquo;re not the only
        one. Correct yourself and move on. If I correct you, that means you
        have made me feel safe enough to advocate for myself. Believe it or
        not, it&rsquo;s a compliment.
